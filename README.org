* RayPortal 
  Another retro raycaster written in Haskell.
 
  + supports arbitrary angles between walls (not just 90 degree angles) 
  + uses a "portal" system to decrease the number of walls to intersect a ray against
  + "sprite" support in progress (stationary and moving objects) 
   
  Uses hsSDL and hsSDL-ttf   

* FONT
  The font used comes from the liberation-fonts (https://fedorahosted.org/liberation-fonts/) package
  and is under a license as described in the file Data/Font-License.txt.
  
  hsSDL-ttf causes segfaults! (no idea how to use this library correctly) 
  
* TODOs 
  
  + collision against walls
  + doors, items, monsters, etc
  + level editor
  + Floor and ceiling textures
